							I'm Ariel, a fourth year student in the honors college at <a href="http://www.gvsu.edu/" target="_blank">Grand Valley State University</a> majoring in Computer Engineering. I am also the Vice President and former Treasurer of the <a href="http://gvsu.swe.org/" target="_blank">GVSU Collegiate Section of Society of Women Engineers</a>. I have an interest in working with embedded systems and have experience in various technological positions including embedded software testing.
						</p>
						<p>
							I've always loved working on projects. In my free time I like working on things involving graphic design, programming, and web design. I also enjoy making greeting cards and raising my kitten, May.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am proficient and farmiliar in multiple programming languages including C, C++, Arduino C, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, CFML, and SQL. I also enjoy learning new ones!
						</p>
						<p>
							Something that I am very passionate about is collaborating with and inspiring women in engineering. Part of this is because my journey to engineering started out due to the <a href="https://www.mcwt.org" target="_blank">Michigan Council of Women in Technology (MCWT)</a>, an organization whose mission is to make Michigan the top state for women in tech. In my senior year of high school I was part of GET-IT, a program by MCWT that encourages high school girls to pursue a career in technology. I listened to speakers, placed in the annual web design contest, and won an award with my team in the annual Robofest competition.
						</p>
						
						<p style="clear: left;">
							During my second year of college I was awarded the <a href="https://www.mcwt.org/Scholarships_196.html" target="_blank">MCWT Undergraduate Scholarship</a>, worth up to $15,000 over three years, for my involvement in technology and commitment to academics. I was honored to speak on <a href="http://www.wjr.com/" target="_blank">WJR</a>, a popular Detroit-based radio station, to raise awareness for the scholarship and the importance of diversity in technology professions.

							In college I continue my involvement with women in engineering through the <a href="http://societyofwomenengineers.swe.org/" target="_blank">Society of Women Engineers</a>. I am the Vice President of this organization at GVSU where I help plan meetings, recruit new members, and organize events. I also had a great time volunteering at a local girls FIRST robotics competition. It brings a smile to my face to be in a room full of competent, professional engineers who are also women like me.
