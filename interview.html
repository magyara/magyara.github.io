				<h1>Interview of a Type 1 Diabetic</h1>
				<p>
					Jensyn Cone is a fourth year medical student and will be graduating from the University of South Carolina School of Medicine this spring. She will be starting her residency in the summer at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center as a pathologist. Jensyn was diagnosed with type I diabetes at a young age and has successfully learned to live with her disease as a busy, young adult. She is now 27 years old. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>How old were you when you found out you had diabetes?</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Jensyn:</strong> I was nine. I always forget if I was seven or nine. Now that I think about it, I was diagnosed in 1997, so I must have been nine. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>What was the hardest change in lifestyle you encountered?</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>J:</strong> The hardest change I would say was learning how to deal with my day when my blood sugar was bad. It wasn't the loss of the things I couldn't eat. Some days I had to do stuff and I didn't feel great and I had to figure out a way to get through my day.

				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Did having diabetes affect your relationships (friends, family)?</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>J:</strong> I think, yeah, in a couple of different ways. I tend to not be a worrier. I'll go and go until I can't go anymore. I think I'm able to fix things. It made people worry about me all the time when I was with them. Some moms were afraid for me to come over because they didn't want me to die while I was with them. People didn't usually believe me when I said I was fine (justifiably). 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>How did it affect your schooling?</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>J:</strong> First of all, I was very blessed to be a homeschool kid. I am also an introvert. I enjoy sitting down to think and plan in my head. If I wasn't feeling well, I could take a break and not worry. I could just do stuff later. I was able to have the flexibility I needed to get through the day.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Did you receive any help from the government at all?</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>J:</strong> Michigan has a program where children under 18 with certain diseases are given money for medical supplies. Whatever the child's insurance companies don't cover, the program covers. It's tough to get into. My mom worked hard to do all the paperwork to be eligible. I didn't have to pay for medical costs until I was 19. I then realized how expensive diabetes supplies can be! 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Did you receive any compensation to help you pay for college?</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>J:</strong> Nope. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>What is currently the biggest challenge you face because of your diabetes?</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>J:</strong> Well, again going through medical school, the first two years are free form. Students can attend class or are free to study on their own. During the third year you have to start acting like a true doctor-in-training. This included seeing patients and conducting physical examinations. The schedule is more rigorous and the individual students don't have control over their schedule. Trauma surgery was tricky; if my blood sugar wasn't great, I had less control, because I couldn't just leave the trauma patients. The days were longer and busier and I had less control over my schedule.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>How has having diabetes affected your major life choices?</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>J:</strong> Well, having it and going to the doctor got me interested in medicine. That was one of the major factors that caused to me start thinking about a career in medicine. I was comfortable with it because of the frequency with which I visited the doctor. I understood a little bit of what was going on and I thought it would be an interesting career. I decided to go to medical school. In medical school, some of the careers were too structured for my personal desires. If I wanted to take care of myself, I needed an environment where I could decide how much work I do and how fast. Pathology is perfect for this reason; I get to work in lab, or do autopsies. I won't actually be working with living patients who need a physical exam. I'm happy with my choice because it's a job I'm interested in and gives me the best opportunity to take care of myself health-wise.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Have you been able to achieve what you hoped to achieve when it comes to your career?</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>J:</strong> Yeah! I have been. Well, in certain senses, yes and no. When I started, I loved surgery. I loved the hands on aspect of fixing a person. I still love surgery and think it's awesome. I love to go the operating room and help. I thought I would be a surgeon and that was my plan. I almost applied. Toward the end of my third year I knew that if I continued down that path I would not feel well in the years to come. I was overwhelmed in med school sometimes, so I knew that diabetes would be stressful while being a surgeon. The cool thing: I have the option to apply to a more fun range of schools for pathology! I get to go to a school that I would have never gotten into with pathology. Diabetes indirectly got me to a better place I wouldn't have been otherwise.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>In your competitive career do you think that you have an advantage over other applicants who are without a disease because an employer is worried about being politically correct? </h2>
				<p>
					<strong>J:</strong> Sometimes people give me more leeway if I don't go to a lecture or leave early from school. The experience of having diabetes and being able to talk about it was a major part of my getting accepted into medical school. I didn't get brownie points, but it was an experience that added to my understanding of health care and the process of going through a disease with another person. Talking about it helped me get into medical school for sure.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>What do you have to do on a daily basis because of your diabetes? What does your daily routine look like?</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>J:</strong> I always wake up and check my blood sugar immediately. Helps me get a baseline for if I'm feeling well and if I need to fix anything. I wear an insulin pump all the time. I no longer give myself injections. The machine is programed to give me small doses throughout the day. It gives me the same amount at the same time every day. Anytime I eat food with carbs or my blood sugar is too high, I tell my pump and it calculates a dosage of insulin to offset that. I also check my blood sugar throughout the day as I need to. I always check it before I go to bed. I calculate how many carbs I eat with each meal and that's what I tell my pump. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>How do you manage your blood sugar?</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>J:</strong> I drink water and exercise if I'm too high or I tell my pump to give me more insulin. If my blood sugar is low I eat sugar (fruit and candy).
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Do you have to check your feet? Do you get thirsty? Increased appetite? Do you have "acetone breath?"</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>J:</strong> Neurological damage is something diabetics get after they've poorly controlled their blood sugar for a long time. I don't have any problems with my feet. To prevent that I have to take care of my diabetes. I haven't had any problems with that so far. Yes, I get thirstier if my blood sugar is too high. I don't think I have an increased appetite. Not usually. That only happens if I take my pump off for 6-7 hours. If I take insulin I don't have that problem.
