					My senior year of high school I designed a five page website using <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>. This was my first big experience in web design and it inspired me to study computer engineering. The project was for the <a href="https://www.mcwt.org/" target="_blank">Michigan Council of Women in Technology's</a> (MCWT) ancestry-themed web design competition, and the criteria was to construct and launch a website about three older relatives.  I was honored to be selected as a finalist and as a part of that I presented my website to a panel of judges.

					This was my first time entering the competition and I entered in the advanced category and placed fourth. My prize included $75 and a trip to Mercedes-Benz Financial Services, which later helped me get an internship working in the IT department there.
					<br/>
					I used Photoshop to make graphics and add effects to pictures and <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">FileZilla</a> to upload my site to the MCWT server.
