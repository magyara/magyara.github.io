				<div class="heading">Paper Circuit 4th of July Card</div>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					One of my favorite hobbies is making greeting cards, and when I learned about paper circuits, I knew I could make a card using the technique. Paper circuits are basically what they sound like: circuits made on paper. Instead of using fiberglass as a base like a typical PCB, paper is used. Copper tape is then used as "traces" and can be cut and folded as needed. Components can then be either taped or carefully soldered to the copper tape.

					For my first paper circuit project, I made a 4th of July card for my parents. I first designed what I wanted my card to look like on scrap paper and then bought copper tape, SMD LEDs, and a 3V coin cell battery. After the design I could start constructing. I cut the copper tape in half for thinner strips and laid it out to mimic fireworks. One strip of the fireworks was connected to the positive side of the battery and the other was to the negative side. The SMD LED was placed accordingly and soldered for a strong hold. Since I didn't want the card to always be lit up, I made a button by placing foam padding around the battery and paper above it. Once someone presses down on the paper, the padding squishes and the positive line connecting all of the LEDS is connected, completing the circuit and making the lights illuminate.

					This project was definitely something unique that I would want to try again. I think paper circuits would be great for teaching children about electronics in an inexpensive and fun way.
