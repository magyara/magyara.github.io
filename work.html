					Embedded Software Testing Co-op

					<a href="http://www.gentex.com/" target="_blank">Gentex</a> is a company that produces automotive, aerospace, and fire protection equipment with a focus on automatic-dimming rear view mirrors. It is headquartered in Zeeland, MI with offices all around the world.  I was an embedded software testing co-op from May through August as part of Grand Valley’s co-op program which requires engineering majors to have three semesters of work experience, and I will be returning during the 2018 winter and fall semesters. In the software testing department, I worked on a team to see the completion of two test iterations of software for mirrors with a total of six feature variations. Software testing is unique in that it allowed me to work with both hardware and software. I had the hands-on experience of soldering wires to test points on boards and removing tiny SMD parts, but also the computer-based experience of creating sequences for tests using classic programming logic using TestStand and Veristand. My favorite part about my experience at Gentex was how I was able to work alongside seasoned engineers at the company to gain real knowledge of what it takes to create product for the customer. As I continued my co-op, I was able to gain more responsibility from putting together test boards to making my own tests. It was rewarding to know the product I worked on may it into a car someday!

					I was part of the <a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/webteam/" target="_blank">Web Development Team at Grand Valley State University</a> in Allendale, MI for five semesters. As a student developer, I fixed errors as they happened on over 510 separate sites and 17,000 content pages across www.gvsu.edu. I also had a hand in creating custom systems tailored to the growing needs of the over 1,190 user CMS client base. The programming languages I used were CFML (ColdFusion), SQL, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

					<a href="http://disherdesign.com/" target="_blank">Disher</a> is a fully-integrated product development and consulting firm that has locations in west and east Michigan. Its staff of engineers helps hundreds of companies ranging from Fortune 500 to independent inventor realize their products. I interned in the electronics department in Zeeland, MI during the summer of 2016. Part of the work I did was running environmental tests with circuit boards using the Thermotron, an environmental testing chamber. I also applied circuit design and assembly skills such as soldering, LTspice, and Arduino C programming. A range of equipment was used, including an oscilloscope, function generator, variable power supply, and digital multimeter.

					I worked as an intern in the IT department at <a href="http://www.mbfs.com/" target="_blank">Mercedes-Benz Financial Services</a> the summer after I graduated high school. It was a six-week program in which I rotated around different sections in IT including project management, shared services, information technology infrastructure, security and web development. I also toured <a href="https://www.demanddetroit.com/" target="_blank">Detroit Diesel</a> to see where they manufactured engines for trucks and volunteered at the <a href="http://www.dia.org/" target="_blank">Detroit Institute of Arts</a>.
