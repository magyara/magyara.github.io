					In this project for my Computer Science I class, I used BlueJ to create a Java class to simulate basic functionality of a smart phone. The owner pretends to do basic tasks such as send texts, stream video, and stream audio. The program can then print a monthly statement summarizing the cost of the services used.
					<img src="images/projects/phoneproject.jpg" class="responsive">
					First I created the class MyPhone with private instance variables for things to be used and changed throughout the class such as number of texts, battery life, and the phone number. I then used a constructer to set the name and phone number to what the user entered and initialized variables for number of texts and battery life to 0.
					<br/>
					After that I created mutator methods to modify the class fields and used private helper methods within them to print the monthly statement, read texts, stream video, etc. 
					<br/>
					I prevented user error by not allowing for negative minutes to be entered when the user sets the amount of time to charge the battery and stream audio and video. I also added a wifi capability which used a boolean flag called wiFiOn to identify if wifi is on or off. If it's on, no data will be used when streaming audio and video but the battery life will still decrease. 
					<br/>
					Finally I created a class called MyPhoneTest to error check my program. It instantiates two phones for different customer names and invokes methods with a variety of parameter values to test for accuracy. If the results are not as expected, an error message is displayed.
