				<h1>Treatment & Diagnosis</h1>
				<h2>Treatment</h2>
				<p>
					The number one form of treatment for type 1 diabetes is regular insulin injections. This is to keep their blood sugar level as normal as possible whenever they ingest glucose. Usually, people with this type of diabetes will start with two injections of insulin per day and gradually increase up to 3 or 4 injections. It has been found with more injections per day, like 3 or 4, there is more control over the blood glucose level and can prevent other bodily damage caused by diabetes. There are many different types of insulin and the kind an individual uses depends on their own personal blood glucose levels. Some of the kinds are rapid acting, short acting, intermediate acting, and long acting. As you probably assume these different kinds vary in the amount of time it takes to reach the bloodstream, when the insulin is most effective and how long it works for.

					The time that a person with type 1 diabetes issues the insulin also is important when trying to control the blood glucose level. The most effective time to take it is about 30 minutes before you eat glucose so that as soon as the glucose enters your bloodstream the insulin is there to control and regulate it. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					While most people intake insulin with a syringe, there are other ways to do it such as using an Insulin Pen or Pump Therapy. With an insulin pen it is much like a syringe but can come pre filled or with a cartridge that you insert. The only problem with this is that it can only hold one type of insulin so you have to do two injections if you use more than one kind. The other way to maintain a constant flow of insulin is by using Pump Therapy. This is a device that is delivered to your body through a catheter that is under your skin. This is helpful because it can deliver insulin to you 24 hours a day whenever you need it. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					If you are using a syringe or insulin pen the area where you inject the insulin on your body also plays an important role. This is because the insulin can enter your bloodstream at different speeds depending on the placement of the injection. For example, it works fastest when injected into the abdomen and slowest in the arms and legs. It is important to use the same area every time so that the insulin reaches your bloodstream in around the same amount of time every time you inject it. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					While insulin is the most important and effective way to control your blood sugar levels with Type 1 diabetes other factors can play a part. What you are eating, how much you are exercising, how stressed you typically are and how often you get sick can also play a part in treating your diabetes. 
				</p>

				<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
				<p>
					There are many different symptoms of type 1 diabetes, usually people will be tested for type 1  diabetes if they have 1 or more symptom such as Increased amounts of urination, excessive thirst or hunger, random weight loss, tiredness or fatigue, numb or tingling hands or feet, increased amount of infections/ sickness, change in vision and dry or itchy skin. If you present some of these symptoms and diabetes is suspected there are 4 possible ways to diagnose the disorder. The most popular way is a A1C (Glycated hemoglobin test). This test is able to show your average blood sugar levels for the past two or three months. If your blood sugar levels have been high your blood will have more homoglobins with sugar attached than normal. If your A1C level is 6.5 percent or higher it means you have diabetes. The second way to diagnose diabetes is with a random blood sugar test. This is when a blood sample is taken at a random time, if you have a blood sugar level higher than 200 mg/dL suggests diabetes, especially if you have symptoms that go along with diabetes as well. The next kind of diagnoses is also a blood sample, but this one is taken after an overnight fast. With this kind, a blood sugar level of 100-125 mg/dL is prediabetes and 125 mg/dL or higher identifies you as having diabetes. The last way to diagnose diabetes is though an oral glucose tolerance test. With this way you still take a fasting blood glucose test but you drink a glucose solution two hours prior.
