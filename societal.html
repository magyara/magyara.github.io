				<h1>Societal Challenges</h1>
				<p>
					A person that suffers with Type 1 Diabetes would face several societal challenges.  <a href="http://www.diabetes-info.co.uk/managing-diabetes/social-issues.html" target="_blank">An article about social issues</a> seen among patients with this disease explains that the diagnosis of Type 1 leads to a complete lifestyle change.  Because Type 1 Diabetes is usually diagnosed among adolescents, and because of this, as they grow older they will have societal challenges in each stage of their life.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>School Life</h2>
				<p>
					Children who have Type 1 Diabetes may feel like they do not fit in, especially when they are old enough to attend school every day.  There are several reports on bullying cases and teasing for children that are treated differently or with special circumstances, and Type 1 Diabetes can fuel this.  However, it is highly important that when they are on their own and not under care of their parents, they are checking their blood sugar and making sure to eat at the right times to help aid this.  Some children struggle with paying close attention to their health when they are away from their parents or care takers.  It is highly important that when they are given the freedom to be on their own that they take constant care of their condition. School nurses and teachers must be aware of the the child's condition and educated on what to do if there was an emergency. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Sports and Exercise</h2>
				<p>
					Not only are societal issues seen with school life, but they can be seen with sports teams.  Sports are a very important part of children's lives because it helps the child grow in social interaction, working in a team, and athletic skills. However, children with Type 1 Diabetes must be cautious on how extended exercise affect their blood sugar level. Exercise is crucial in diabetes management, however too much exercise can cause the glucose levels to be at a dangerous level.  It is important that children get to experience what it is like being on a sports team, and Diabetes should not take that away, but coaches need to accommodate for these individuals to make sure they are staying healthy and having fun.

				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Added Responsibility</h2>
				<p>
					In addition to school and sports, societal issues are seen when the individuals grow older and start having to take responsibility for their disease on their own.  This could be when they move out, go to college, or get their first job.  By this time, the individual most likely has had their condition for a long time and they are responsible with the precautions it entails. However, before this point they did not have as much responsibility  for their own diet, exercise, testing, and medicine.  They are facing a new environment with possible temptations (alcohol, inconsistent sleep, poor eating choices) that could increase the risks of their disease.  Chances are before this point these individuals had their parents checking on them several times a day, and reminding them to take care of their body.  This point in a patient's life can either be a positive change or push them into an unhealthy lifestyle for their condition.
