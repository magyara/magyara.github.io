					In my Computer Science I class, I challenged myself to make each one of my programming projects Qdoba-themed, and the final project was a culmination of that. I created a choose your own adventure game that stars a heroic Qdoba inspector whose task is to visit Qdobas throughout the United States and figure out which one is making fake, sub-par burritos. Buttons along the right side of the GUI allow the user to go north, south, east, and west, and buttons along the bottom allow the player to interact with each room as follows:

						<div style="margin-left: 5%;">
							<b>Help</b> - Gives the player hints to progress through the game<br/>
							<b>Pickup</b> - If there's an item in the room that's light enough to carry, puts it into the player's bag <br/>
							<b>Drop</b> - Removes a specified item from the player's bag and places it in their current room<br/>
							<b>Visit HQ</b> - Transports player to the Qdoba headquarters to report the fake Qdoba<br/>
							<b>Eat</b> - The player can consume an item from their bag if it's edible<br/>
							<b>Look</b> - Displays a description of the current room<br/>
							<b>List</b> - Displays the items in the player's bag<br/>
						</div>

					This game was written in Java using the software BlueJ. I used an array list to create the bag of items and a hashmap to allow the player to move in between rooms. I also created a test class to simulate a player moving through each room and winning the game to ensure that my program worked correctly.
