				<h1>Political & Ethical Issues</h1>
				<h2>Political</h2>
				<p>
					Type 1 Diabetes affects millions of people each year.  Because this disease affects such a large population of people, there are many ethical and political issues that come with this disease.  Politics come into play when looking at the increasing price of diabetes drugs and treatment methods in the last few years.  <a href="http://www.healthcostinstitute.org/files/HCCI%20Diabetes%20Issue%20Brief%205-7-15.pdf" target="_blank">According to a recent study</a>, in 2013 health care spending for people with diabetes averaged $14,999, compared with $4,305 for people without diabetes.  Type 1 Diabetes is an autoimmune disease and is unavoidable for those that have the genetic makeup predisposing them to the disease.  Due to the increase in prices and overall costly expense of drug and treatment methods to cope with this disease, it is becoming more strenuous for people of lower socioeconomic classes to be able to afford treatment.  Looking into the expenses of people with diabetes, middle and upper classes have advantage over these lower classes to obtain the resources that are necessary when diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes.  Not only with the cost of treatment and drugs, but they may be unable to afford consultations and other medical care.  Health care is expensive and several political issues arise with whether it is our duty to help these lower socioeconomic classes obtain the drugs and medical assistance that they need.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Ethical</h2>
				<p>
					Ethical issues arise when evaluating the precautions that should be taken to help aid all the socioeconomic classes who may have this disease.  One must evaluate whether it is ethical for the government to provide compensation to patients who suffer from Type 1 Diabetes.  Expenses are high and diabetes, especially Type 1, is found among millions of people.  Type 1 Diabetes is not caused by poor choices related to health or exercise like Type 2 Diabetes.  Thus, it is not the patient’s control that they have been given this type of disease and so it is the moral thing to do to help aid these people who suffer with this.  So then, more ethical questions come into play when looking at how realistic it that every person being able to receive compensation with this disease. However, looking at it practicality, the government cannot provide and should not provide compensation to millions of people, especially those who are well off and able to afford medicine without any issues.  Compensation can be given to those in lower socioeconomic classes that are not able to afford treatment and medical care to treat this type of Diabetes.  One must also look at how much compensation should be given to each person unable to afford treatment or medical care, due to the large amount of people who have Type 1 Diabetes.  A realistic suggestion would be that the government could pay each person a stipend to help aid in their treatment and other procedures.  
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Ethical issues also arise when looking into different treatment options for Type 1 Diabetes.  <a href="http://www.healthcostinstitute.org/files/HCCI%20Diabetes%20Issue%20Brief%205-7-15.pdf" target="_blank">According to a treatment study</a>, treatment has dramatically changed these past 20 years.  Insulin and oral drugs were the only treatments that were FDA approved for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.  Now, a patient's options are expanded when looking into treatment, but with more options comes more risks.  New treatments and drugs have not been out on the market for as long as previous drugs, and with this comes a whole new set of ethical issues as to whether these methods are safe and effective.
