							Hello! I'm Ariel Magyar, a second year Computer Engineering major at <a href="http://www.gvsu.edu" target="_blank">Grand Valley</a>. Web development is a passion of mine, so I designed and coded this website myself for the Eric Maino Community Technology Award. The languages I used to create it are HTML and CSS. I come from an artistic background and always loved to draw and create growing up. The reason I love working in technology is because I can combine that imaginative background with analytical thinking to come up with creative solutions to problems.
						</p>
						<p>
							I really enjoyed building this website for you, so I hope you enjoy my application!
						</p>

								For the longest time, a career in technology was not for me. I have always been a creative spirit who likes dabbling with watercolors and paints, and I saw STEM fields as being very dull. My prototype image of an engineer was a guy who spent his day hunched over a bright monitor in a dark room doing calculus that I would never understand, and when I thought of STEM I just did not think of me.  
							</p>
							<p>
								During my freshman year of high school, my answer to "What do you want to be?" was "No clue." By my junior year, I said I wanted to be a Graphic Designer. But by my senior year of high school, something changed: I decided to join <a href="https://www.mcwt.org/GET-IT_Program_184.html" target="_blank">GET-IT</a>, an organization that sought to introduce girls to technology. Upon joining, I was excited because the first large event of the year was a web design competition. Coincidentally, I had previously taught myself HTML, a language for coding websites, in middle school, and actually really enjoyed it, but never connected something so intriguing and creative like designing a website to working in the "boring" field of tech. GET-IT showed me, however, that technology does not have to be dull and it is a field that welcomes imagination.  
							</p>
							<p>
								I spent months perfecting my <a href="projects.html#web" target="_blank">Ancestry-themed website</a> and victoriously placed fourth in the Advanced Category, despite it being my first time entering the contest. This really got my creative juices flowing, and I challenged myself to create my own personal self-coded website. I developed the pages, purchased a domain name, uploaded my files and images to a server, and to this day it is still up and running at <a href="index.html" target="_blank">arielmagyar.com</a>.

								Entering Grand Valley, I thought I wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer. I loved to draw and thought that designing parts would be right up my alley. Then in my <a href="http://catalog.gvsu.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=42&coid=64316" target="_blank">Intro to Engineering Design I class</a> we started working with Arduinos, programmable prototyping platforms, and I realized that it was the aspect of class I enjoyed the most. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I thought it was incredible that something I programmed could cause a light to flash, a motor to run, or a robot to act according to information from a sensor array. I officially declared my major in Computer Engineering by the end of my freshman year and have been enjoying it ever since.

								During winter break of my freshman year of college I wanted to make some extra money so I researched available jobs on campus. I saw a Student Web Developer position was open and applied for it, even with being almost entirely self-taught in HTML and CSS and not having a single clue what queries were. I recently reached my one year anniversary of working in that position on the <a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/webteam/" target="_blank">GVSU Web Team</a> and have developed websites for clients all across the university, ranging from forms for events to full blown systems. I have learned to create tables within the database, draw out information using SQL, and implement it with ColdFusion. 
							</p>
							<p>
								All of that being said, my leading point of pride would have to be finding my passion and taking all steps necessary to pursue it. I am proud to bring creativity to a field that often values scholarship over ingenuity, and I enjoy debunking stereotypes each time I am asked, "What do you want to be?"

								I had the awesome opportunity to intern in the IT department at <a href="https://www.mbfs.com" target="_blank">Mercedes-Benz Financial Services</a> during a six-week summer program just before my freshman year of college. This program was unique in that each week I went to a different department, so I got to experience a lot of what IT has to offer. I worked in project management, shared services, information technology infrastructure, security, and web development. I also toured Detroit Diesel and volunteered at the Detroit Institute of Arts. 
							</p>
							<p>
								This summer, I have an internship lined up at <a href="http://disherdesign.com/" target="_blank">Disher Design & Development</a> in Jenison, MI where I'll be working in electronics design. I'll use languages that I've learned in class such as C, C++, and Java to create real world solutions to client needs. I'll also be working in app development to help expand the company beyond electrical and mechanical engineering and further into software development.

							I now know that technology is my passion and I love figuring out effective ways to solve problems. In the future, I'd like to work with embedded software because I think it's interesting how programs can be written to control physical machines, and I want to be a part of that. I would also like to lead workshops to educate people about the opportunities to apply creativity within the field of technology and the need for out-of-the-box solutions that are not taught in a textbook.

								Earning the Eric Maino Community Technology Award would be huge for me. This scholarship would help me juggle achieving high grades, working in web development in between classes, and pursuing personal tech-related projects such as my website in my free time without as much of the added financial stress college places on me. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I'd like to give a big thank you to the Eric Maino Community Technology Award committee for considering my application and listening to my story.  It means a lot that you're helping students accomplish their dreams by helping fund their education, and I hope you find some awesome people to give the award to!
