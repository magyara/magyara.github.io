				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					For my first college engineering class (EGR 106) final, I worked with a partner to create a line following robot. This was the first real robot I created and it is great to look back on it and see how far I have come. Our class hosted a competition at the end of the semester and ours was one of the fastest to finish the course. The guidelines for the line follower were as follows:
						<div style="margin-left: 5%;">
							<b>1.</b> Each device must fit in a box with internal dimensions measuring 100mm by 100mm by 200mm. <br/>
							<b>2.</b> Each device must incorporate one part designed by the team and machined using the CNC machines in the milling lab. <br/>
							<b>3.</b> No use of the 3D printer. <br/>
							<b>4.</b> Each device will use the Arduino board for sensor, motor control, and any other computations required. <br/>
							<b>5.</b> Each device is autonomous.  <br/>
							<b>6.</b> Prohibited materials include: cardboard, paper, wood, tape (as a method of jointing), and refuse materials (beverage containers, paper towel tubes, etc.). <br/>
							<b>7.</b> Budget: Maximum of $40 for materials ~ not including the Arduino. <br/>
						</div>
						Robots were scored based on how far and fast they navigated a path consisting of a straight line, gentle curve, more extreme curve, and a right angle.

						To start, my partner and I came up with a list of specifications our robot had to meet. We then did some benchmarking and brainstorming and finally came up with a morphological chart of three different concepts to try. Above are two of the prototypes I constructed out of cardboard, tape, and loose leaf based on these concepts.
					<br/>
						As we started gathering the parts to build our final robot, my partner and I realized that we would have to divert from our original prototype design. In order to keep the robot stable, we added a small piece of plastic at the front. We also decided to use only one deck to stay on budget and had to add weight to the end to prevent skidding.

						Finally, here's a video of the completed project. We ended up naming the robot "Burnout" since it burnt out a 10k resistor and my partner's hand. It successfully completed the entire track with a record time of 23.5 seconds, earning us an A!
					<br/>
						I wrote the program for the robot using the Arduino IDE software. I was also in charge of figuring out the schematic for the wiring and adjusting the program based on how it caused the robot to perform.

						Materials used: Arduino UNO, SainSmart Arduino Motor Shield, tamiya DC dual motor, tamiya wheels X2, battery pack, AA batteries X6, plastic pieces from milling lab, small breadboard X2, IR LED X2, phototransistor X2, 1k resistor X2, 10k resistor X2, assorted wires, electrical tape, screws, and weights (washers and a bolt).
